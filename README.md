# Fantasy Coach and GM of the Year

This project aims to analyze performance of a fantasy football team's starters each week relative to the performance of the entire team (bench included). This allows us to see who has the best team overall (including their bench players), and who made the most with what they had by putting up the best performances relative to their team as a whole.
